# Interactive_Quiz_App
This is a basic quiz application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches multiple-choice questions from the Open Trivia API and allows users to select a category, answer questions, and track their score. The app includes question numbering, category selection, and displays the final result at the end. It is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. This project was created to showcase frontend development skills and working with APIs.
